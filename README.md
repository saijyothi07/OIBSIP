🌦️ Weather Info CLI Tool
This is a Python command-line tool that allows users to fetch real-time weather information for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
It displays the current weather condition (like Clear, Rain, Clouds, etc.) and the temperature in Fahrenheit. 
The user simply enters the city name, and the script retrieves and prints the weather data.
